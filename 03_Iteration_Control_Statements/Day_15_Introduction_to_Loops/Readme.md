# âš¡Introduction to Loops

## Loops?

## <img src="1.png ">

Loops are the iteration control structure which are used to repeat a block of statements or code.

## Why we need loops?

Loops come in use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements without rewriting the same block of codes over and over.

## Components of loops?

Every loop contains basically three components.

- initialization
- condition for termination
- update

## Types of loops?

Majorly, there are two types of looping control statements i.e. entry controlled and exit controlled.

- Entry controlled loop consists for() and while() loops.
- Exit controlled loop consists do-while() loop.

## for() loop

for() loop first intializes, then checks condition and executes body and then update.<br>

#### Syntax:

```cpp
  for(initialization; condition; update)
  {
    //body of loop
  }
```

## while() loop

while() loop first checks the condition, then executes the body.
<br>

#### Syntax:

```cpp
  while(condition)
  {
    //body of loop
  }
```

## do-while() loop

do-while() loop first executes the body then checks the condition.
<br>

#### Syntax:

```cpp
  do
  {
    //body of loop
  }while(condition);
```
