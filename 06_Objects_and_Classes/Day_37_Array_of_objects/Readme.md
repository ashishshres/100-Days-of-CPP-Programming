# âš¡Array of objects

- An array of objects is a collection of objects of the same class type that are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Since each item in the array is an instance of the class, each one's member variables can have a unique value.
- This makes it possible to manage and handle numerous objects by storing them in a single data structure and giving them similar properties and behaviours.
- We can think of array of objects as a single variable that can hold multiple values.
- Each value is stored in a separate element of the array, and each element can be accessed by its index.

#### Syntax:

```cpp
    class_name object_name[number of objects];
```

## Program

```cpp
// Program to demonstrate array of objects

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class student // class
{
  int id;
  string name;

public:
  void setData(void)
  {
    cout << "Enter id and name of student: ";
    cin >> id >> name;
  }

  void getData(void)
  {
    cout << "Student info..." << endl;
    cout << "Id: " << id << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "----------------------" << endl;
  }
};

int main()
{
  student s[10]; // array of object
  int size;
  cout << "Size of student (1-10): ";
  cin >> size;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
  {
    s[i].setData();
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
  {
    s[i].getData();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```
Output:
Size of student (1-10): 2
Enter id and name of student: 1 Bishal
Enter id and name of student: 2 Aryan
Student info...
Id: 1
Name: Bishal
----------------------
Student info...
Id: 2
Name: Aryan
----------------------
```
